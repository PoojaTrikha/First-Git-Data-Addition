# Bank lab!

Today we're making a simple bank app! The desired functionality is described in the user stories below.

Use the code in the `start` folder to get started.

The other directories contain an example of the program with various stories finished. So use those if you get stuck.

## Userstories:

- 0.) As a new user I want to be able to create a new account by giving my name and a pin, so I can start to organise my finances

- 1.) As a user I want to be able to login using my id and pin, so I can access my account

- 2.) As a user I want to know if I made a mistake while logging in, so I realise something went wrong

- 3.) As a user I want to be able to try to log in again, so I can make a mistake

- 4.) As a logged-in user I want to be able to choose to withdraw money, deposit money or quit the app, so I can do what I need to do

- 5.) As a logged-in user withdrawing money I want to see how much money is my account,so I know how much I can withdraw

- 6.) As a logged-in user withdrawing money I want to choose how much money to withdraw, so I get the exact amount I need

- 7.) As a logged-in user withdrawing money, the withdrawn money should end up in my wallet, so I can use it to buy things in the real world

- 8.) As a bank director I want to prevent people from withdrawing more money than they have on their balance, so I don't go out of business

- 9.) As a logged-in user I want to be able to deposit money in my account, so I can keep it safe

- 10.) As a bank director I don't want people to be able to deposit money they don't have, so I don't go out of business

- 11.) As a dissatisfied user I want to be able to close my account, so I can take my business elsewhere

- 12.) As a dissatisfied user I want to receive al remaining money in my account when I close it, so I can take my money with me

- 13.) As a bank director I want people to be able to try max. 3 times to log in, so my login cannot be brute forced
